# Mission
You have entered the main page of the infamous hater group Accessibility haters.
They have a web page that is extremely un-accessible and your job is to change that so it's accessible to everyone.

They also have a special event next December, the Accessibility Haters Conf 2019.
You'll want to buy tickets to this event and wreak havoc!

## Warning!
The AccHaters group has made it extemely hard for users, especially those that need to use assistive technology, to buy tickets.
So you might need to use something like Mac's built in VoiceOver to be able to buy tickets.


Here are a few useful VoiceOver shortcuts:
CMD+F5 to turn on VoiceOver on OS X
Normal keyboard operation (TAB, Shift+TAB, arrow keys etc.) work as normal with VoiceOver running
CMD+L to jump to address bar
CTRL+Option+U to open Web Rotor
Type search term with Web Rotor open to search within Web Rotor
CTRL + Option + ← ↑ ↓ → to explore content
CTRL + Option + CMD + H to move forward by heading
CTRL + Option + CMD + Shift + H to move backward by heading

## Competition
Please make a PR with as many accessibility fixes you can.
If you are able to buy tickets please take a screenshot of the success screen and add it to your PR aswell.
